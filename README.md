# Machine Learning Paper Implementations from Scratch

My personal collection of clean, educational PyTorch implementations of classic ML papers.

Currently implemented:
- [Vanilla Seq2Seq with LSTM (Sutskever et al., 2014)]([seq2seq-lstm-translation/](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)) – English → German translation
