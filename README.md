# Machine Learning Paper Implementations from Scratch

My personal collection of clean, educational PyTorch implementations of classic ML papers.

Currently implemented:
- [Vanilla Seq2Seq with LSTM (Sutskever et al., 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215) – English → German translation
- [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (Bahdanau et al., 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)
- [Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space (Mikolov et al., 2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)
